## DF.com HTML
A brief outline I put together of Daring Fireball's markup based on the styles I've applied:

    div#Box (site container)
      div#Banner (masthead)
      div#Sidebar (nav and ads)
      div#Main (main content)
        dl.linkedlist
        h2.dateline
        hr.ookiaks
        div.article
          h1
          h6.dateline
          p
          blockquote
            p

## Disclaimer
This is a quick little side project. I reserve the right to change anything at anytime, so keep that in mind when installing. I cannot offer technical support for installing user styles either; just Google for "[browser] user styles" and you should be set.
